## Description

This application is a workout tracker for daily use. The application starts at a homepage that shows the previous workout's breakdown if one has previously used the application. Once a user creates a new workout they select a type of workout, enter the workout's data, and then complete (press complete if only workout was completed if not press add workout). This application also has a graphical breakdown from the dashboard link in the header navbar.
